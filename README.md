 Vera Molnár's Generative Art Recreation and Remix in TouchDesigner

Projects

1.Gen4Vid: Recreation Project- A reproduction of Molnár’s generative art style using square grids. The piece mimics her use of systematic patterns and geometric manipulation.

2.Gen5Vid: Remixed Project- This remix introduces colour-reactivity to the grid-based system. The squares' color transformations are now influenced by movement of the squares.

Vera Molnár is a French artist and one of the pioneers of generative art. She is known for her geometric and algorithmic works, often based on grids and simple shapes like squares. Molnár uses algorithms to manipulate shapes and create visually complex and evolving patterns.Through her innovative use of algorithms, she creates intricate visual patterns that evolve over time, making her one of the first to embrace the potential of computer-generated art. I thought it would look interesting if the color of the piece would fade over time similarly to how the shape of the squares morph and fade.
